# Anglify

This project is intended to provide a number of components that are easily extensible, easily customizable, and look
good by default. The components are also intended to address the weaknesses of the Angular Material components.

## Roadmap üöè

The first stable version of the entire library will not be released until there are a large number of basic components
that are globally customizable using custom CSS properties and providers.

The following components will be implemented:
