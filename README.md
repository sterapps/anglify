# Anglify

This project is intended to provide a number of components that are easily extensible, easily customizable, and look
good by default. The components are also intended to address the weaknesses of the Angular Material components.

The project is only at the beginning. The already implemented components are available on their own branches and are
published as own libraries in the meantime.

## Roadmap üöè

The first stable version of the entire library will not be released until there are a large number of basic elements
that are globally customizable using SCSS variables and providers.

The following components will be implemented:

- [ ] Badge
- [ ] Bottom Navigation
- [ ] Button
- [ ] Card
- [ ] Chip
- [ ] Dialog
- [ ] Icons
- [ ] Text Field
- [ ] Toolbar
- [x] Tooltips
- [ ] Select
- [ ] Slider
- [x] Stepper
- [ ] Radio Button
